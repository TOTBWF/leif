# Leif
Leif provides a GPS overlay onto any physical map.

## Usage
First, take a photo of the map. Then, place the red dot over your current location, and press the "Finish Calibration" button.
Then, as GPS points get overlayed atop the map, scale and rotate the trail so that it matches your desired route.

## Future Plans
- Use OpenCV to auto-fit the trail to the map
- Display a compass pointer
- Auto-Calibrate scaling based off map scales
